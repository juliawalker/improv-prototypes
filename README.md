 NetBeans Platform Applications
-------------------------------------------------------

1. ImprovApp: A prorotype application displaying data with the Prefuse Tree Map.
The input data are based on your local file system hierarchy.  After checking out files, compile the main App and run from NetBeans.

2. ImprovSqliteApp: A prototype application in progress.
After checking out, compile individual modules (ImprovLibWrapper, ImprovCommonApi, ImprovDataSource, branding, and application)  except ImprovTreeMapVis.  Run the app.  The only thing you can do right now is right click and select one of sample DB instances as an active data source.
